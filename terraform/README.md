# Terraform

These templates serve as a reasonable set of defaults
for spinning up a simple storefront setup,
consisting of:

- A database server
- Two database instances, one each for the API and CMS
- Two database users, one each for the API and CMS
- A storage bucket for assets uploaded in the CMS
- A VPC and various networking utilities to facilitate Cloud Run -> Cloud SQL
- Cloud Run services for:
  - The API
  - The CMS
  - The web front-end

While building Docker images and deploying via Terraform
is automated by the
[Github workflow](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
and associated [Github secrets](../docs/deploy/assign-secrets/README.md),
it is possible to build images and deploy manually if desired.

This requires:

- [Specifying input variables](#input-variables)
- [Configuring `gcloud` and `docker`](#authorize-gcloud)
- [Pushing docker images](#build-and-push-docker-images)
- [Initializing Terraform](#initialize-terraform)
- [Applying Terraform](#apply-terraform)

## Input variables

The configuration is [fairly parameterized](./variables.tf).
Any input variable without a default value needs to be supplied when we want to
either `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`.

You can specify them via stdin while running a command, but it's easier
to either create a `terraform.tfvars` file or supply them as environment variables.
See the [sample file](./sample.terraform.tfvars) for example values.

Again, you must supply every variable that does not have a default value;
and you are free to override any variables that do.

## Authorize gcloud

Whether building and deploying locally or via CI/CD,
the docker images built for the different services should be pushed
to the Artifact Registry docker repository created above.

You will first need to authenticate `glcoud` using the service account
credentials for the project.

```bash
$ gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=<service-account.json>
```

Next, `docker` needs to be configured to authenticate with `gcloud`
for the given registry. For instance, if the repository was created
in the `us-east4` region, the registry will be `us-east4-docker.pkg.dev`.

```bash
$ gcloud auth configure-docker us-east4-docker.pkg.dev
```

## Build and push docker images

Now we can build the docker images, naming them with a prefix specifying:

- The regional registry
- The GCP project
- The AR repository name

Again, assuming `us-east4` region, a GCP project id of "my-project",
and an Artifact Registry repository named "storefront", building and
pushing the API service image would look like:

```bash

$ docker build \
    -f <project-root>/docker/deploy/api/Dockerfile \
    -t us-east4-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/storefront/api:latest \
    .

$ docker push us-east4-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/storefront/api:latest
```

When deploying via Terraform, save the `us-east4-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/storefront/api:latest`
image name in the `api_image` variable,
and do the same for both the CMS and the web front-end.

> **Note:** You will want to **avoid the `latest` tag**,
> as Terraform will not be able to detect that the images have been changed
> and will not issue new Cloud Run revisions.

## Initialize Terraform

Before we can set up infrastructure, we have to configure where
Terraform stores its state file.
The [current configuration](./main.tf#L4) specifies using a GCS bucket as
the storage location (rather than, say, locally on the machine running `terraform`),
so we need to specify the bucket name and optionally a prefix for the state file
(if we want it nested in a folder inside the bucket).

Terraform also needs access to the bucket via a service account
key stored in the `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` environment variables.
The value of the variable needs to be the JSON key itself, newlines included,
rather than a filename.

```bash

# Supply the JSON directly
$ export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS='{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "<project-id>",
  ...rest of JSON
}'

# Or load from the JSON file
$ export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=$( cat path/to/credentials.json )

# Initialize terraform
$ terraform init \
    -backend-config="bucket=<bucket-nane>" \
    -backend-config="prefix=my/terraform"
```

With any luck, you should see output like the following:

```
Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "gcs"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/google from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/google v3.81.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

**Note:** If there was already a state file stored at that location,
Terraform will sync the initialized files in the hidden `<project-root>/terraform/.terraform` local directory
and will not attempt to re-create any resources.

## Apply Terraform

With all input variables defined, you can run `terraform plan` for an overview of the resources that will be created,
and `terraform apply` to set up the infrastructure.

The initial setup will take a decent amount of time, given that the database server alone might take 5-10 minutes to provision.

## Troubleshooting

### State lock

Terraform creates a "lock file" when it is actively querying or updating the stack via `plan` or `apply`, respectively.
If the process exits prematurely, it might not clean the file up, and subsequent attempts to run those commands
will fail.

If the lock id has been output at some point, you can clean this up via `terraform force-unlock <lock_id>`.
If not, you will have to delete the lock file manually - you can find it in the same location as the state file.
